DO NOT RUN SORTER.PY FIRST
Run Setup.py First. This will create all of the necessary folders.
After, You may run sorter.py and let it run in the background.

------------------------------

This Program will sort through all of the files that you put in a specific folder and move them to different locations on your
computer, specified by you.

The only two scripts that you will need to run is setup.py and sorter.py. The rest of the scripts are either unusable (coming in a future update)
or are called on. 

cx_Freeze was unable to make a executable because of copying/building issues with system files. MSI installers and .EXE files are coming in a future update.
